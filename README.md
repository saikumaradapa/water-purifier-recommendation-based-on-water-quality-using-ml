# Water Purifier Recommendation Based on Water Quality using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to recommend suitable water purifiers by analyzing water quality parameters. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can make informed recommendations based on specific water conditions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Compilation of water quality parameters including pH, turbidity, hardness, sulphates, and conductivity values.
- **Data Clustering**: Grouping of similar water samples for better classification.
- **Data Labeling**: Categorizing clustered data for prediction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizing models to predict and recommend the right water purifiers based on provided water quality parameters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - matplotlib 


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
